# 3-in-1 Smart Car

**Bluetooth Control â€¢ Line Following â€¢ Obstacle Avoidance**

This project showcases a **multi-functional robotic car** that integrates **three control modes** into a single platform:

1. **Bluetooth Control** â€“ Drive the car manually using a smartphone app or controller.
2. **Line Following** â€“ Automatically follow a track using IR sensors.
3. **Obstacle Avoidance** â€“ Detect and avoid obstacles using ultrasonic sensors.

The car is designed to be versatile, educational, and fun â€” a great example of combining hardware, sensors, and embedded programming.

## âš¡ How It Works

1. **Mode Selection:**

   * A switch or Bluetooth command selects one of three modes.

2. **Bluetooth Mode:**

   * The Arduino listens for commands from the Bluetooth module and adjusts motor speed/direction accordingly.

3. **Line Following Mode:**

   * IR sensors continuously read track position.
   * The Arduino adjusts motor speeds to stay centered on the line.

4. **Obstacle Avoidance Mode:**

   * The ultrasonic sensor measures distance ahead.
   * If an obstacle is detected within a threshold, the car stops and turns automatically.
